    title: Charlie
    subtitle: Android Development
    bg: charlie-bg
    body: Charlie is a musical companion app. It lets you recognize songs and makes musical suggestions in a UX-friendly chat interface. I paired with my old friend and awesome designer Taulant for this project and helped with the design by providing feedback during the design sprints based on personal experience with Material Design and Android UI and UX implementation. I developed the Android app from scratch and integrated with Discogs and Gracenote and YouTube APIs.
