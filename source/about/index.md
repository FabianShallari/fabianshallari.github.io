Since you have somehow, stumbled upon my corner on the internet, let me bother you with some information about myself and my whereabouts. 

As you probably have noticed by now, my name is **Fabian Shallari** and I am a software engineer focused on **Android**, currently based in **Tirana, Albania**.

My journey with computers started in my early teens. My father had a fresh new **Gateway** laptop that he used to bring home from work, which I started using to chat on **MSN** with my friends. After spending enough time fixing my MySpace Top 8, I got bored and driven by the fact (or rather bothered by it) that I was using a remarkable piece of technology while knowing nothing about its inner workings, I felt an inner urge to start tinkering with it. 

And no, this is not the classical story about how I started to tear it apart and couldn’t figure out how to reassemble it again in one piece. Somehow I knew that looking at the hardware was not going to teach me anything. I was curious more about the software. So I started digging inside the file system, making password protected folders *(wink-wink)*, you know the usual “amateur thinking he can control this thing” sort of thing. After a while, the laptop, started to become slower and slower (it was running an unlicensed version of Windows XP, with no antivirus, and its main user was a teen who had just discovered the internet, *you can’t really blame Microsoft, right?* **_RIGHT?_**). 

Being desperate to fix it, I asked a friend what I should do and he told me: “Oh just delete the files that are not useful, it’ll be as good as new”. And so I did, I deleted all those useless, space-wasting *.conf* and *.dll* files that nobody needed, inside those esoteric *system* and *system32* folders.

And yes, that was the last day in the life of a Gateway laptop, the first of many laptops and PCs that went prematurely to become electronic waste because of my tinkering. And thus dear reader, you have just received your first lesson on software design (which took Microsoft a decade to fix): “Never expose the inner guts of your system to the end user. They will utterly destroy it".

----------

I was introduced to programming and databases on my last high school year. When I executed my first *“printf(“Hello World);”* program, it was astonishing. I made the computer do that! I went on to study computers and software at the Polytechnic University of Tirana and more recently I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering. 

Nowadays I spend most of my time writing code, something I have been doing for more than 5 years; while the last 2 to 3 years have been exclusively on writing apps on **Android**. I am a fan of good abstractions, clean code and maintainable software architecture (things not very easy to achieve, especially on Android). 

When I'm not writing code, I am reading about writing code. I am an avid reader of software and computer science literature, be it books, blog posts or anything else that can help me better my skills and give me more insight into software architecture and frameworks. Below are some of my favorite books that I have had the pleasure to read recently:

On the weekends I play football (soccer) and go biking around the country. I am a fan of good music, mostly indie rock and minimal techno. I also used to play bass guitar on a punk band during my teens but unfortunately I literally don’t know anything about playing music since I got in it for the girls. (The bassist plays the easiest instrument in a band, so he can enjoy on the perks, right?)
